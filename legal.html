    <h2>Legal Safe Harbor</h2>
    <p>We appreciate your efforts in helping us maintain a secure environment. To encourage responsible reporting of security vulnerabilities, we provide the following legal safe harbor:</p>

    <p>Our organization commits to not pursue legal action against security researchers who:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Act in good faith to identify and report security vulnerabilities.</li>
        <li>Adhere to our bug bounty program rules and guidelines.</li>
        <li>Respect user privacy and comply with applicable laws.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This legal safe harbor is limited to security research conducted within the scope of our bug bounty program. It does not grant immunity for malicious activities or actions that violate our terms of service.</p>

    <p>We value the contributions of the security community and thank you for your responsible and ethical collaboration.</p>
